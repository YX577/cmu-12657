Welcome to the 12-657 Project Section on Climate Cange Impacts Analysis for the Yakima River Basin.

You can **navigate the website** using the links in the **top menu**.

This part of the project consist on **three different tasks**. At the end of each, there is a link to a **quiz**
about the content on each task. You must complete each quiz to obtain full mark in this part of the project.

## Introduction

Your consulting firm has been hired to complete the next installment in the analysis of the water supply in the Yakima River Basin. One of your collegues, who read the National Climate Assessment that was released last year is concerned about the climate panorama that is described in this report. Your collegue suggested your team to further investigate the potential impacts of climate change in the river basin to make the results of your analysis more robust.

One member of your firm shared stories about the successful growing collaboration between water resources managers and climate scientists to understand what are the potential future conditions that will impact a specific watershed using General Circulation Models (or Global Climate Models) (GCM).

Your team decides to use the output data from these models to analyze the potential changes in the water cycle (mostly precipitation) in the Yakima River Basin.

For this purpose, there are three different tasks that you must complete:

- [**Task 1**](docs/Task1.md): _Familiarize with Climate Model Output_

    In this task, you will learn what GCM in general are, the shortcomings of these models, downscalling techniques to understand local impacts and the different model runs that are freely available for you to analyze.

- [**Task 2**](docs/Task2.md): _Familiarize with RCM output format, Python commands and libraries to extract data_

    In this task, you will learn about the data format that is commonly used to store GCM/RCM data. Subsequently, you will learn useful Python commands and the [netCDF4 library](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/). You will go through a tutorial-like activity to extract precipitation data from a specific dataset, and store it in a friendlier format for analysis.

- [**Task 3**](docs/Task3.md): _Compute descriptive statistics to get insights on climate change impacts on the Yakima River Basin_

    In this task, you will perform a statistical analysis on different metrics that will help you understand and arrive to conclusions about what impacts the Yakima River Basin will face.
