    "In Python, you need to import a package before using it. It is a good practice to import the packages at the beginning of the code. There are packages for Python that are very commonly used that they are assigned an \"alias\" to be used throughout the code without having to write its complete name every time one wants to use a function from it. For instance NumPy and Pandas are two very commonly used libraries. They are commonly imported as:\n",

    "This means that we are only importing the module/class/function \"array\" from numpy. Any other class/function that are part of numpy will not be accesible/able to be used throughout the notebook. However, sometimes you only want to use one specific function from a package, and there is no need to load it fully. If you don't use an alias, to call the function you need to use the complete name, in this case `array`."
