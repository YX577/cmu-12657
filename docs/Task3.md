## Task 3. Compute descriptive statistics to get insights on climate change impacts on the Yakima River Basin

In this task, you will perform a statistical analysis on different metrics that will help you understand and arrive to conclusions about what impacts the Yakima River Basin will face.

----

## Learning Objectives

1. Compute descriptive statistics of different metrics to study climate change
2. Characterize the impacts that the Yakima River Basin will face under climate change
3. Draw conclusions that will help guide water supply planning and management in Naches

First, we will analyze climate change impacts in the city of Naches.

You already have the data for the city of Naches from Task 2 in a .csv format which you can manipulate using commonly used packages such as Excel.

The reason we will focus on Naches is because its agriculture is extensive. Potential changes in rainfall frequency or intensity in the area might have serious consequences in terms of higher withdrawals during hot months, or particularly in the case of orchids, large volumes of rainfall when cherries are ripe, they can get so full of water that they can burst, causing them to split.

Farmers in this case will incur in higher costs because when it is a particularly rainy season, farmers will sometimes hire helicopters to dry off their fruit, so it doesn’t split.

We will investigate some of the following: (for some using the ETCCI indeces) (Tank & Zwiers, 2009):

- **Annual total precipitation**
- **Mean precipitation rate of change per year**
- **Dry spells (CDD) Maximum length of dry spell**, or in other words, maximum number of consecutive days with precipitation < 1 mm in both, the control and the pseudo-global warming run
- **Wet spell (CWD) Maximum length of wet spell**, or in other words, maximum number of consecutive days with precipitation ≥ 1 mm in both, the control and the pseudo-global warming run
- **Average monthly precipitation**
- **Seasonality of rainfall**
- **Simple Precipitation Intensity Index**, or in other words, the ratio of the total precipitation falling during wet days (days with precipitation ≥ 1 mm) and the total number of wet days.

----
After you compute the differet statistics for each model run (in other words, compute the "current" or "historical" indeces by using the _retrospective_ (CTRL) run and computing the "future" indeces by using the _future_ (PGW) run, make a comparison and analyze how they are different.

Draw useful conclusions about what are the different aspects of precipitation that you think will have greater impact in Naches area.
